RFS Bundle DB
=============

Still in development. At this point you can clone the repo then you must run 
    bower install
    
If you happen to use RubyMine (which I highly recommend as an IDE for Ruby on Rails Development) 
you have to copy the contents of the components directory into the javascripts directory so that
RubyMine doesn't yell at you for not being able to resolve the path to the javascript files.
