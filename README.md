RFS Bundle DB
=============

Still in development. At this point you can clone the repo then you must run `bower install`.
    
If you happen to use **RubyMine** (which I highly recommend as an IDE for Ruby on Rails Development) 
you have to copy the contents of the components directory into the javascripts directory so that
RubyMine doesn't yell at you for not being able to resolve the path to the javascript files. 

If you are not using RubyMine all you have to do is run `bower install` and the assets will be in the right place anyway.

Prerequisites
=============

* Ruby on Rails 4.1.4
* Ruby 2.1.2p95
* Bower
* Ubuntu (Just a recommendation, it's what I use on my web servers and I'll be able to give better support on setting this up if you are using the same OS
